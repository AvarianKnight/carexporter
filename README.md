# carexporter

This is a simple resource for exporting vehicle/tires names so they're not NULL when in game.

All you have to do is go to exporter -> and double click 'exporter.exe' or you can compile it from the source (if you know how).

**This resource needs to be in your home directory, not in a subdirectory like [local]**

This will go through your entire resource folder and search for vehicles.meta and carcols.meta and extract names from the xml, this will also print any errors that your files have.

This resource doesn't have any support.
