# carexporter

This is a simple resource for exporting vehicle/tires names so they're not NULL when in game.

All you have to do is go to exporter -> and double click 'exporter.exe' or you can compile it from the source (if you know how).

This will go through the directories you selected to generate the game data from the meta files, this can be instant, or take multiple minutes depending on how many cars you have.

You can also run this resource in 'headless' mode, just change the `headless.bat` path to the one you want it to run in.

This resource doesn't have any support.
